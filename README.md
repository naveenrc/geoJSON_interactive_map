# geoJSON interactive map
This notebook walks through creating interactive maps using geoJSON multipolygons, Bokeh patches and a slider with a callback function.

Notebook provides complete steps in plotting choropleth map.

As the geoJSON points are huge, notebook takes a few seconds to render. To speed up the process in notebook we can use WebGL in bokeh. WebGL uses GPUs and makes the process easy.
